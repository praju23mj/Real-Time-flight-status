  Error Handling

Network Errors: If there is an issue fetching data from the API (e.g., due to network issues or API limits), the application will display the message:

"Error fetching flight data. Please try again later."

Flight Not Found: If the user clicks on a flight that doesn't exist or the flight ID is invalid, the application will show:

"Flight details not found."

General Errors: If any other errors occur (e.g., issues with API data format), the application will catch them and display a generic error message like:

"An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later."
